Obesity is a well-established risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer, and the significant weight loss resulting from bariatric surgery helps to lower this risk. [11, 13] Several studies have quantified this risk reduction. For instance, a retrospective cohort study published in the journal *Annals of Surgery* found that bariatric surgery was associated with a 45% reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (Hazard Ratio = 0.55). [5, 8] Another study highlighted by the Australasian Menopause Society found a similarly reduced risk (HR 0.58). [6] The mechanism for this risk reduction is linked to the fact that excess fat tissue produces estrogen, and high estrogen levels can fuel the growth of some breast cancers. [2] By inducing weight loss, bariatric surgery reduces circulating hormones and inflammation associated with cancer development. [2, 13]\\\",\\n            \\\"evidence\\\": \\\"A retrospective cohort study published in PubMed and other sources demonstrated that bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced risk of both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer. For postmenopausal women, the hazard ratio was 0.55, indicating a significantly lower risk.\\\",\\n            \\\"evidence_url\\\": \\\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30998538/\\\",\\n            \\\"verified\\\": \\\"Incorrect\\\",\\n            \\\"confidence_level\\\": \\\"High\\\"\\n        }\\n    ]\\n}\\n```\"\n",

postmenopausal breast cancer, not an increase. Obesity is a well-established risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer, and the significant weight loss resulting from bariatric surgery helps to lower this risk. [11, 13] Several studies have quantified this risk reduction. For instance, a retrospective cohort study published in the journal *Annals of Surgery* found that bariatric surgery was associated with a 45% reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (Hazard Ratio = 0.55). [5, 8] Another study highlighted by the Australasian Menopause Society found a similarly reduced risk (HR 0.58). [6] The mechanism for this risk reduction is linked to the fact that excess fat tissue produces estrogen, and high estrogen levels can fuel the growth of some breast cancers. [2] By inducing weight loss, bariatric surgery reduces circulating hormones and inflammation associated with cancer development. [2, 13]\",\\n            \"evidence\": \"A retrospective cohort study published in PubMed and other sources demonstrated that bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced risk of both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer.

Background: Obesity is associated with increased risk of breast cancer, but the impact of weight loss on breast cancer risk has been difficult to quantify. Methods: The cohort included obese (body mass index ≥35 kg/m2) patients enrolled in an integrated health care delivery system between 2005 and 2012 (with follow-up through 2014). Female bariatric surgery patients (N = 17,998) were matched on body mass index, age, study site, and comorbidity index to 53,889 women with no bariatric surgery. Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine incident breast cancer up to 10 years after bariatric surgery. Pre- and postmenopausal women were examined separately, and further classified by estrogen receptor (ER) status. Results: The analysis included 301 premenopausal and 399 postmenopausal breast cancer cases. In multivariable adjusted models, bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced risk of both premenopausal (HR = 0.72, 95% CI, 0.54–0.94) and postmenopausal (HR = 0.55, 95% CI, 0.42–0.72) breast cancer. Among premenopausal women, the effect of bariatric surgery was more pronounced among ER-negative cases (HR = 0.36, 95% CI, 0.16–0.79). Among postmenopausal women, the effect was more pronounced in ER-positive cases (HR = 0.52, 95% CI, 0.39–0.70). Conclusions: Bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer among severely obese women. These findings have significant public health relevance because the prevalence of obesity continues to rise, and few modifiable breast cancer risk factors have been identified, especially for premenopausal women.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Bariatric Surgery is Associated With Reduced Risk of Breast ... : Annals of Surgery\\n\\nURL: https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/abstract/2020/12000/bariatric_surgery_is_associated_with_reduced_risk.29.aspx\\nPublished: 2024-06-16T22:48:58.000Z\\n\\n![](https://cdn.wolterskluwer.io/wk-logos/1.0.x/favicon.png?rev=43)![](https://journals.lww.com/_layouts/15/images/spcommon.png?rev=43)\\n\\n- [Annals of Surgery](https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/pages/default.aspx)\\n- [Annals of Surgery Open](https://journals.lww.com/aosopen/pages/default.aspx)\\n\\n[December 2020 - Volume 272 - Issue 6](https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/toc/2020/12000)\\n\\n[Article as EPUB](https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/abstract/2020/12000/bariatric_surgery_is_associated_with_reduced_risk.29.aspx#epub-link)\\n\\n[Export All Images to PowerPoint File](https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/abstract/2020/12000/bariatric_surgery_is_associated_with_reduced_risk.29.aspx?Ppt=Article|annalsofsurgery:2020:12000:00029|10.1097/sla.0000000000003331|)Add to My Favorites\\n\\nColleague's E-mail is Invalid\\n\\nYour Name:\\n\\nColleague's Email:\\n\\nSeparate multiple e-mails with a (;).\\n\\nMessage:\\n\\nYour message has been successfully sent to your colleague.\\n\\nSome error has occurred while processing your request.

Findings  \\n In this population-based, matched multiple cohort study including 69 260 women with obesity, there was no residual risk of breast cancer associated with weight loss after bariatric surgery, and surgical weight loss was associated with reduced risk of breast cancer development compared with maintaining body mass index greater than 25. Meaning  \\n Findings suggest that the association between substantial weight loss and breast cancer risk is sustained and appears to be associated with removal of the residual risk of obesity for women. \\n Importance  \\n Excess adiposity confers higher risk of breast cancer for women. For women who have lost substantial weight, it is unclear whether previous obesity confers residual increased baseline risk of breast cancer compared with peers without obesity. Objectives  \\n To determine whether there is a residual risk of breast cancer due to prior obesity among patients who undergo bariatric surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants  \\n Retrospective matched cohort study of 69 260 women with index date between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2016. Patients were followed up for 5 years after bariatric surgery or index date. Population-based clinical and administrative data from multiple databases in Ontario, Canada, were used to match a cohort of women who underwent bariatric surgery for obesity (baseline body mass index [BMI] ≥35 with comorbid conditions or BMI ≥40) to women without a history of bariatric surgery according to age and breast cancer screening history. Nonsurgical controls were divided into 4 BMI categories (&lt;25, 25-29, 30-34, and ≥35). Data were analyzed on October 21, 2021. Exposures  \\n Weight loss via bariatric surgery. Main Outcomes and Measures  \\n Residual hazard of breast cancer after washout periods of 1, 2, and 5 years. Comparisons were made between the surgical and nonsurgical cohorts overall and within each of the BMI subgroups. Results  \\n In total, 69 260 women were included in the analysis, with 13 852 women in each of the 5 study cohorts. The mean (SD) age was 45.1 (10.9) years. In the postsurgical cohort vs the overall nonsurgical cohort (n = 55 408), there was an increased hazard for incident breast cancer in the nonsurgical group after washout periods of 1 year (hazard ratio [HR], 1.40 [95% CI, 1.18-1.67]), 2 years (HR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.12-1.53]), and 5 years (HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.21-1.58]). When the postsurgical cohort was compared with the nonsurgical cohort with BMI less than 25, the hazard of incident breast cancer was not significantly different regardless of the washout period, whereas there was a reduced hazard for incident breast cancer among postsurgical patients compared with nonsurgical patients in all high BMI categories (BMI ≥25). Conclusions and Relevance  \\n Findings suggest that bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced risk of developing breast cancer for women with prior obesity equivalent to that of a woman with a BMI less than 25 and a lower risk when compared with all groups with BMI greater than or equal to 25. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Invited Commentary \\n Bariatric Surgery for Breast Cancer Risk Reduction \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Full Text \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ||||I||||[Skip to Navigation]\\n Our website uses cookies to enhance your experience.

Pilewskie, MD; Justin B. Dimick, MD, MPH\\n Full Text\\n Key Points\\n\\n Question Is there an association between obesity after weight loss and breast cancer risk?\\n\\n Findings In this population-based, matched multiple cohort study including 69 260 women with obesity, there was no residual risk of breast cancer associated with weight loss after bariatric surgery, and surgical weight loss was associated with reduced risk of breast cancer development compared with maintaining body mass index greater than 25.\\n\\n Meaning Findings suggest that the association between substantial weight loss and breast cancer risk is sustained and appears to be associated with removal of the residual risk of obesity for women.\\n\\n Abstract\\n\\n Importance Excess adiposity confers higher risk of breast cancer for women. For women who have lost substantial weight, it is unclear whether previous obesity confers residual increased baseline risk of breast cancer compared with peers without obesity.\\n\\n Objectives To determine whether there is a residual risk of breast cancer due to prior obesity among patients who undergo bariatric surgery.\\n\\n Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective matched cohort study of 69 260 women with index date between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2016. Patients were followed up for 5 years after bariatric surgery or index date. Population-based clinical and administrative data from multiple databases in Ontario, Canada, were used to match a cohort of women who underwent bariatric surgery for obesity (baseline body mass index [BMI] ≥35 with comorbid conditions or BMI ≥40) to women without a history of bariatric surgery according to age and breast cancer screening history. Nonsurgical controls were divided into 4 BMI categories (<25, 25-29, 30-34, and ≥35). Data were analyzed on October 21, 2021.\\n\\n Exposures Weight loss via bariatric surgery.\\n\\n Main Outcomes and Measures Residual hazard of breast cancer after washout periods of 1, 2, and 5 years. Comparisons were made between the surgical and nonsurgical cohorts overall and within each of the BMI subgroups.\\n\\n Results In total, 69 260 women were included in the analysis, with 13 852 women in each of the 5 study cohorts. The mean (SD) age was 45.1 (10.9) years. In the postsurgical cohort vs the overall nonsurgical cohort (n = 55 408), there was an increased hazard for incident breast cancer in the nonsurgical group after washout periods of 1 year (hazard ratio [HR], 1.40 [95% CI, 1.18-1.67]), 2 years (HR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.12-1.53]), and 5 years (HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.21-1.58]). When the postsurgical cohort was compared with the nonsurgical cohort with BMI less than 25, the hazard of incident breast cancer was not significantly different regardless of the washout period, whereas there was a reduced hazard for incident breast cancer among postsurgical patients compared with nonsurgical patients in all high BMI categories (BMI ≥25).\\n\\n Conclusions and Relevance Findings suggest that bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced risk of developing breast cancer for women with prior obesity equivalent to that of a woman with a BMI less than 25 and a lower risk when compared with all groups with BMI greater than or equal to 25.\\n\\n * Invited Commentary\\n Bariatric Surgery for Breast Cancer Risk Reduction\\n Full Text\\n Access through your institution\\n Add or change institution\\n Comment\\n\\n Read More About\\n\\n Breast Cancer Oncology Women's Health Surgery Bariatric Surgery Obesity\\n Download PDF Full Text\\n Cite This\\n\\n Citation\\n\\n Doumouras AG , Lovrics O , Paterson JM, et al.

Background: Obesity is associated with increased risk of breast cancer, but the impact of weight loss on breast cancer risk has been difficult to quantify. Methods: The cohort included obese (body mass index ≥35\\u200akg/m2) patients enrolled in an integrated health care delivery system between 2005 and 2012 (with follow-up through 2014). Female bariatric surgery patients (N = 17,998) were matched on body mass index, age, study site, and comorbidity index to 53,889 women with no bariatric surgery. Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine incident breast cancer up to 10 years after bariatric surgery. Pre- and postmenopausal women were examined separately, and further classified by estrogen receptor (ER) status. Results: The analysis included 301 premenopausal and 399 postmenopausal breast cancer cases. In multivariable adjusted models, bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced risk of both premenopausal (HR = 0.72, 95% CI, 0.54–0.94) and postmenopausal (HR = 0.55, 95% CI, 0.42–0.72) breast cancer. Among premenopausal women, the effect of bariatric surgery was more pronounced among ER-negative cases (HR = 0.36, 95% CI, 0.16–0.79). Among postmenopausal women, the effect was more pronounced in ER-positive cases (HR = 0.52, 95% CI, 0.39–0.70). Conclusions: Bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer among severely obese women. These findings have significant public health relevance because the prevalence of obesity continues to rise, and few modifiable breast cancer risk factors have been identified, especially for premenopausal women.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Bariatric Surgery is Associated With Reduced Risk of Breast ... : Annals of Surgery\\n\\nURL: https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/abstract/2020/12000/bariatric_surgery_is_associated_with_reduced_risk.29.aspx\\nPublished: 2024-06-16T22:48:58.000Z\\n\\n![](https://cdn.wolterskluwer.io/wk-logos/1.0.x/favicon.png?rev=43)![](https://journals.lww.com/_layouts/15/images/spcommon.png?rev=43)\\n\\n- [Annals of Surgery](https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/pages/default.aspx)\\n- [Annals of Surgery Open](https://journals.lww.com/aosopen/pages/default.aspx)\\n\\n[December 2020 - Volume 272 - Issue 6](https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/toc/2020/12000)\\n\\n[Article as EPUB](https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/abstract/2020/12000/bariatric_surgery_is_associated_with_reduced_risk.29.aspx#epub-link)\\n\\n[Export All Images to PowerPoint File](https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/abstract/2020/12000/bariatric_surgery_is_associated_with_reduced_risk.29.aspx?Ppt=Article|annalsofsurgery:2020:12000:00029|10.1097/sla.0000000000003331|)Add to My Favorites\\n\\nColleague\\'s E-mail is Invalid\\n\\nYour Name:\\n\\nColleague\\'s Email:\\n\\nSeparate multiple e-mails with a (;).\\n\\nMessage:\\n\\nYour message has been successfully sent to your colleague.\\n\\nSome error has occurred while processing your request.

Findings \\xa0\\n In this population-based, matched multiple cohort study including 69\\u202f260 women with obesity, there was no residual risk of breast cancer associated with weight loss after bariatric surgery, and surgical weight loss was associated with reduced risk of breast cancer development compared with maintaining body mass index greater than 25. Meaning \\xa0\\n Findings suggest that the association between substantial weight loss and breast cancer risk is sustained and appears to be associated with removal of the residual risk of obesity for women. \\n Importance \\xa0\\n Excess adiposity confers higher risk of breast cancer for women. For women who have lost substantial weight, it is unclear whether previous obesity confers residual increased baseline risk of breast cancer compared with peers without obesity. Objectives \\xa0\\n To determine whether there is a residual risk of breast cancer due to prior obesity among patients who undergo bariatric surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants \\xa0\\n Retrospective matched cohort study of 69\\u202f260 women with index date between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2016. Patients were followed up for 5 years after bariatric surgery or index date. Population-based clinical and administrative data from multiple databases in Ontario, Canada, were used to match a cohort of women who underwent bariatric surgery for obesity (baseline body mass index [BMI] ≥35 with comorbid conditions or BMI ≥40) to women without a history of bariatric surgery according to age and breast cancer screening history. Nonsurgical controls were divided into 4 BMI categories (&lt;25, 25-29, 30-34, and ≥35). Data were analyzed on October 21, 2021. Exposures \\xa0\\n Weight loss via bariatric surgery. Main Outcomes and Measures \\xa0\\n Residual hazard of breast cancer after washout periods of 1, 2, and 5 years. Comparisons were made between the surgical and nonsurgical cohorts overall and within each of the BMI subgroups. Results \\xa0\\n In total, 69\\u202f260 women were included in the analysis, with 13\\u202f852 women in each of the 5 study cohorts. The mean (SD) age was 45.1 (10.9) years. In the postsurgical cohort vs the overall nonsurgical cohort (n\\u2009=\\u200955\\u202f408), there was an increased hazard for incident breast cancer in the nonsurgical group after washout periods of 1 year (hazard ratio [HR], 1.40 [95% CI, 1.18-1.67]), 2 years (HR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.12-1.53]), and 5 years (HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.21-1.58]). When the postsurgical cohort was compared with the nonsurgical cohort with BMI less than 25, the hazard of incident breast cancer was not significantly different regardless of the washout period, whereas there was a reduced hazard for incident breast cancer among postsurgical patients compared with nonsurgical patients in all high BMI categories (BMI ≥25). Conclusions and Relevance \\xa0\\n Findings suggest that bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced risk of developing breast cancer for women with prior obesity equivalent to that of a woman with a BMI less than 25 and a lower risk when compared with all groups with BMI greater than or equal to 25. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Invited Commentary \\n Bariatric Surgery for Breast Cancer Risk Reduction \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Full Text \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ||||I||||[Skip to Navigation]\\n Our website uses cookies to enhance your experience.
