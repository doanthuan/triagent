# Clinical History

**Initial Presentation**:
- 10/24/2023: Experienced a seizure at work, transported to ED
- Brain mass noted on CT of head
- Started on Keppra and dexamethasone

**Surgery and Initial Treatment**:
- 10/30/2023: Underwent tumor resection, left craniotomy with fluorescein, gleolan, and subcortical stimulation (Dr. Albert Kim)
- 12/08/2023: Enrolled in BN011 clinical trial, randomized to standard of care arm
- 12/08/2023 - 01/23/2024: Completed IMRT with concurrent temozolomide (75mg/m² daily)

**Adjuvant Treatment**:
- 02/26/2024: Began high-dose temozolomide (150mg/m² for 5 days)
- 03/18/2024: Initiated Optune therapy (Tumor Treating Fields)
- 03/25/2024: Cycle 2 high-dose temozolomide (increased to 200mg/m² for 5 days)
- 04/17/2024: Cycle 3 high-dose temozolomide (reduced to 150mg/m² due to thrombocytopenia)
- 05/15/2024: Cycle 4 high-dose temozolomide (150mg/m² for 5 days)
- 06/12/2024: Cycle 5 high-dose temozolomide (150mg/m² for 5 days)
- 07/10/2024: Cycle 6 high-dose temozolomide (150mg/m² for 5 days)

**Breakthrough Seizure**:
- June 2023: Urgently hospitalized for breakthrough seizure while on a flight
- Keppra increased to 1500mg BID
- Due to mental fog and fatigue, dose adjusted to 1000mg QAM and 1500mg QPM
- MRI showed largely no change, nothing to explain breakthrough seizure

**Immunotherapy**:
- 08/21/2024: Started pembrolizumab (200mg Q3W)
- 08/22/2024: Started personalized neo-antigen peptide vaccine
- 02/26/2025: Last boost dose of neo-antigen vaccine

**Disease Progression**:
- 03/15/2025: Presented to ED with expressive aphasia
- 03/17/2025: Repeat MRI brain showed new enhancing mass in left parietal lobe
- 03/19/2025: Underwent biopsy/LITT (Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy), pathology confirmed recurrent GBM
- 03/24/2025: Scheduled to start TMRPT (TMZ re-challenge with radiation therapy), continue TTF in between RT sessions

# Imaging Findings

**Most Recent MRI (03/15/2025)**:
- Postoperative changes of left parietal craniotomy, mass resection, and laser interstitial thermal therapy
- Scalp soft tissue edema overlying the craniotomy
- Vasogenic edema in the left fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital white matter
- Mass effect on the trigone of the left lateral ventricle
- Small 9mm segment of enhancement at the superior and anterolateral margins of the resection/treatment cavity, suspicious for residual tumor
- The remainder of enhancement appears to be post-radiation and post-treatment changes

# Laboratory Values (03/19/2025)

**CBC**:
- WBC: 10.4 (H)
- HGB: 13.5
- HCT: 39.4
- Platelets: 213

**Chemistry**:
- Sodium: 138
- Glucose: 122
- Calcium: 8.8
- Potassium: 4.4
- CO2: 28
- Chloride: 102
- BUN: 18
- Creatinine: 0.96

**Coagulation**:
- INR: 1.12
- PT: 12.1
- APTT: 30

# Current Medications

- Dexamethasone 1mg tablet: 3mg q12h for 7 days, then 2mg q12h for 7 days, then 1mg q12h (started March 20, 2025)
- Fluoxetine 20mg capsule: 40mg daily and 20mg nightly
- Lacosamide 50mg tablet: 50mg BID
- Levetiracetam 1,000mg tablet: 2,000mg nightly
- Levetiracetam 750mg tablet: 1,500mg every morning (started March 21, 2025)
- Rosuvastatin 20mg tablet: 20mg three times weekly (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
- Telmisartan 80mg tablet

## Treatment considerations
- pateint has already tried checkpoint inhibitors and neoantigen vaccine and they didnt work as the disease recurred
