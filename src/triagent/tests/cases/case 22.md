## Medical Notes
**VP Shunt Information**: A ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt is a medical device used to treat hydrocephalus (excess cerebrospinal fluid in the brain ventricles). The system consists of a catheter placed in the brain ventricles, a one-way valve that regulates fluid flow, and another catheter that carries fluid to the peritoneal cavity (abdomen) where it can be absorbed. VP shunts may impact clinical trial eligibility as some trials exclude patients with central nervous system hardware due to concerns about drug delivery/distribution or infection risk.

## Clinical Questions
1. What clinical trials are available for recurrence, given the presence of a VP shunt?
