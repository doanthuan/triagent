## Clinical Questions

1. Is an n of 1 exception possible to gain access to Amezalpat (TPST-1120) to add to current first line SOC (atezolizumab + bevacizumab) for metastatic HCC?
2. What other effective therapies are there for Stage IV HCC (in a patient without comorbidities and a functioning liver)?
