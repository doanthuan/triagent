## Clinical Questions

1. What are appropriate surveillance tools beyond yearly scans for Polymorphic Adenocarcinoma Low Grade that can recur 10-20 years after initial diagnosis?
2. Could the diagnosis be mistaken given that the mutations (S100, P63, P40) are not typical for this diagnosis?
3. Need for oncology consultation as patient was never assigned an oncologist (MSK only assigns oncologists to patients receiving chemotherapy)
