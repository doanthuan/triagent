# Patient Summary

**Patient**: Georges Andre Soare  
**Age**: 64 years  
**Sex**: Male  
**DOB**: May 27, 1960  
**Diagnosis**: Duodenal Adenocarcinoma  
**Institution**: University Health Network, Toronto General Hospital  

# Molecular Pathology

**Immunohistochemistry Findings**:
- **DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) Protein Testing**:
  - **MLH1**: Loss of nuclear expression
  - **PMS2**: Loss of nuclear expression
  - **MSH2**: Intact nuclear expression
  - **MSH6**: Intact nuclear expression
  - **Internal Control**: Background non-neoplastic tissue shows intact nuclear expression
  - **Interpretation**: Loss of nuclear expression of one or more MMR proteins indicates deficient mismatch repair
  - **Clinical Significance**: 
    1. MSI-H (microsatellite instability-high) phenotype likely present
    2. May predict sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibition
    3. Indicates potential Lynch syndrome, requiring additional testing
    4. MLH1/PMS2 loss pattern often seen in sporadic cases with MLH1 promoter methylation
- **Additional Testing Ordered**:
  - MLH1 promoter methylation studies for further classification
  - Macro-dissection of 7mm tumor-rich area with 85% tumor cellularity for DNA isolation and testing

**Additional Notes on MMR Testing**:
- Protocol posted: 30/06/2021
- Testing performed at Toronto General Hospital
- Results reported on 02/04/2025
- Signed by Dr. Mireille Boivin
- Pathologist comment: "The presence of MSI-H / deficient mismatch repair may also be an indication for additional testing for Lynch syndrome and genetic counselling. Heterogeneous expression of MLH1 and PMS2 has been infrequently encountered in endometrial carcinomas (up to 3% of cases). The incidence of heterogeneous expression in other cancer types and its impact on predicting sensitivity to checkpoint inhibition is not currently known."

# Clinical History

**Recent Cardiac History**:
- NSTEMI (non-ST elevation myocardial infarction) in January 2025
- Angioplasty with 1 stent placed on 14/01/2025
- Currently on dual antiplatelet therapy
- Recent stress test was normal
- Echocardiogram scheduled for April 10, 2025

**Diagnosis of Current Malignancy**:
- Gastroscopy performed on 24/03/2025 by Dr. Habal
- Revealed an ulcerated lesion in D2/3 (second/third part of duodenum)
- Biopsies confirmed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma


- **MMR Status**: Deficient mismatch repair (dMMR)
  - Loss of nuclear expression of MLH1 and PMS2
  - Intact nuclear expression of MSH2 and MSH6
  - MLH1 promoter methylation studies ordered

**Imaging**:
- CT scan (14/03/2025) findings:
  - Irregular thickening of the third part of the duodenum with adjacent prominent retroperitoneal lymph node
  - Multiple mildly prominent upper retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes
  - Portacaval lymph node measuring 1 cm (previously 0.4 cm)
  - No evidence of distant metastatic disease


**ECG (14/03/2025)**:
- Normal sinus rhythm
- Normal ECG
- Heart rate: 60 bpm
- QTc interval: 420 ms


# Current Medications

- Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 81 mg oral daily
- Atorvastatin 80 mg oral nightly
- Bisoprolol 1.25 mg oral daily
- Ramipril 2.5 mg oral daily
- Esomeprazole 40 mg oral daily
- Tadalafil 5-10 mg oral PRN
- Clobetasol 0.05% ointment topical BID PRN

# Family History

- Mother died in her 50s with lung illness and bowel cancer
- Has 2 sons (>20 years old) who have both had colonoscopies


# Assessment and Plan

**Assessment**:
- 64-year-old male with newly diagnosed poorly differentiated duodenal adenocarcinoma
- Deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) status suggests potential responsiveness to immunotherapy
- Likely a new primary lesion rather than recurrence from previous colon cancer
- No evidence of distant metastasis but has regional lymph node involvement
- Recent cardiac history complicates potential surgical intervention
- dMMR status raises consideration for Lynch syndrome genetic testing

**Treatment Considerations**:
- Deficient MMR status suggests potential candidacy for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy
- Surgical options may include duodenal and/or pancreatic resection with Roux-en-Y hepatobiliary reconstruction
- Cardiac status needs careful consideration in surgical planning due to recent NSTEMI and dual antiplatelet therapy
