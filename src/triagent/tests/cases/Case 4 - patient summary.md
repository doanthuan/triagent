# Patient Summary

**Patient**: Not specified  
**Age**: Not specified  
**Sex**: Male (implied by "he")  
**Diagnosis**: Reoccurant Glioblastoma, WHO Grade 4, MGMT status unknown
**Institution**: OHSU Knight Cancer Center (Portland, OR)  


**Key Molecular Features**:
- MGMT promoter: unknown
- CDKN2A: Deleted (CNA-Seq)
- CDKN2B: Deleted (CNA-Seq)
- EGFR: Amplified (CNA-Seq); EGFR-SEPTIN14 fusion (RNA-Seq)
- EGFRvIII: Pathogenic Isoform (RNA-Seq)
- MTAP: Deleted (CNA-Seq)
- PTEN: Pathogenic Variant p.Y68C (c.203A>G) with 64% variant frequency
- TERT: Pathogenic Variant c.-124C>T with 28% variant frequency
- TP53: Pathogenic Variant p.R273H (c.818G>A) with 36% variant frequency

# Clinical History

**Initial Diagnosis**:
- Stage: Stage 4 glioblastoma

**Disease Progression**:
- Tumor continued to grow despite treatment and reoccoured
- Patient enrolled in lomustine/L19TNF trial but that didnt work
- Experienced seizure
- Developed left side neglect, loss of sensation, and headaches
- Started on dexamethasone to manage symptoms

**Current Status**:
- Active tumor growth despite treatment
- Symptomatic with neurological deficits
- Currently on dexamethasone therapy
- Exploring additional treatment options

# Family History
- None reported

# Treatment Considerations

- Tumor progression despite lomustine/L19TNF trial, showing limostine and L19TNF  as not effective 
- Traditional neuro-oncologists suggest limited options (surgery, Avastin, or Avastin + carboplatin) but the family wants to explore different options
- Seeking molecularly-guided treatment approaches
- Preference for combination therapies over monotherapies
- Plan to reduce dexamethasone as much as possible to improve immune response
- Considering and prefer neoajunctive immunotherapy / Surgical intervention
- Personalized vaccine from Germany
- Family seeking more innovative treatment approaches than those suggested by traditional neuro-oncologists
