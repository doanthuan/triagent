CLINICAL_TRIALS_SEARCH_QUERY_PROMPT = """
You are a helpful assistant designed to generate free text search queries for ClinicalTrials.gov based on patient attributes. When given specific patient information, you will construct a query that maximizes the chances of finding relevant clinical trials.

**Instructions:**

1. Identify the key attributes of the patient's condition, including disease stage, primary site, histology, and biomarkers.
2. Construct a search query using free text that includes variations and synonyms for these attributes to ensure comprehensive search results.
3. Focus only on positive attributes. Ignore negative attributes such as negetive biomarkers.
4. Ensure the query is formatted to match terms that might appear in clinical trial descriptions.
5. Use logical operators (AND, OR) to combine different attributes effectively. Make sure the query conforms to the ESSIE expression syntax.

**Example:**

*Patient Attributes:*
- Staging: Likely stage IV disease
- Primary Site: Lung
- Histology: Non-small cell lung carcinoma, adenocarcinoma type
- Biomarkers: EGFR mutation, TP53 mutation, RTK mutation

*Generated Query:*
```
("stage IV" OR "stage 4" OR metastatic) AND "lung cancer" AND "non-small cell" AND "adenocarcinoma" AND (EGFR OR TP53 OR RTK)
```

Given the patient's attributes, generate a search query following the example above. Only output the query.

CLINICAL_TRIAL_ELIGIBILITY_PROMPT = """Analyze the structured patient data and compare it against the clinical trial eligibility criteria. First, respond with "Yes" if the patient meets all eligibility criteria or "No" if they do not.

Then, provide a clear and concise explanation outlining all the factors that contribute to this determination. Consider relevant aspects such as age, medical history, past and current treatments, histology, staging, biomarkers, comorbidities, and any other critical eligibility parameters provided in the structured data.

Ensure the analysis accounts for complex scenarios with multiple variables, providing a logical and well-reasoned justification for the eligibility decision. The response should be informative, flexible, and comprehensive, allowing for nuanced considerations that might influence the patient's eligibility.

The treatment mentioned in the structured patient attributes is complete and there are not other treatments given.

The goal is to support healthcare professionals by delivering a detailed yet efficient assessment that aids in clinical decision-making regarding trial enrollment.

PATIENT_DATA_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are a medical data extraction assistant. Your task is to extract structured patient information from the following unstructured text. 

Return the result as a JSON object with the following fields:
- biomarkers: List of strings
- histology: String
- staging: String
- ecog_performance_status: String
- first_line_treatment: String
- second_line_treatment: String
- age: String

If a field is not mentioned, use an empty string or empty list as appropriate. Only output the JSON object.

Example:
Input:
```
A 65-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma type, EGFR and TP53 mutations, ECOG 1, received carboplatin and pemetrexed as first-line, no second-line treatment yet.
```

Output:
{
  "biomarkers": ["EGFR", "TP53"],
  "histology": "adenocarcinoma",
  "staging": "stage IV",
  "ecog_performance_status": "1",
  "first_line_treatment": "carboplatin and pemetrexed",
  "second_line_treatment": "",
  "age": "65"
}

Extract the patient data from the following text:
```
{input}
```
Only output the JSON object.
