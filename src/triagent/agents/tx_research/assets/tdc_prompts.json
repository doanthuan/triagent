One such metric, Developability Index (DI), relies on an antibody\u2019s hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions as inferred from its three-dimensional structure. \nQuestion: Given an antibody heavy chain and light chain sequence, whether it\n(A) is non-developable (high DI) (B) is developable (low DI)\nAntibody heavy chain sequence: {Antibody heavy chain sequence}\nAntibody light chain sequence: {Antibody light chain sequence}\nAnswer:",

The PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) is a short DNA sequence that follows the DNA region targeted for cleavage by the CRISPR-Cas9 system. One particular measure of interest for repair outcome quantification is the average insertion length.\nQuestion: Given a GuideSeq sequence, predict its normalized average insertion length from 000 to 1000, where 000 is minimum average insertion length and 1000 is maximum average insertion length.\nGuideSeq: {GuideSeq}\nAnswer:",
    "Leenay_Avg_Deletion_Length": "Instructions: Answer the following question about CRISPR repair outcomes.\nContext: CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing technology that allows targeted deletion or modification of specific regions of the DNA within an organism. This is achieved through designing a guide RNA sequence that binds upstream of the target site which is then cleaved through a Cas9-mediated double stranded DNA break. The cell responds by employing DNA repair mechanisms (such as non-homologous end joining) that result in heterogeneous outcomes including gene insertion or deletion mutations (indels) of varying lengths and frequencies. Primary T cells are a promising cell type for therapeutic genome editing, as they can be engineered efficiently ex vivo and transferred to patients.
